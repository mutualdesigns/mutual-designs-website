WP-Project is a complete project management solution seamlessly integrated into the WordPress 

administrative area.



== Description ==



The WordPress administrative interface is friendly and comfortable.  For web designers and

developers, there is no better place to spend your time.  Instead of having to visit several

disparate websites to manage your projects and project progress, why not do it from the WordPress

interface?  Well, now you can with WP-Project.



WP-Project provides many of the capabilities you'd expect to see from any standard project management 

solution.  Currently, these capabilities include the following:



* Track clients

* Track projects by client

* Track tasks by project

* Track time per task with dynamic timer like Harvest



It is expected that the feature list will be expanded over time under direction of users.
